**18\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION**

**Generally**. Except as described in the Sections titled “Exceptions” and “Opt-Out” below, you and CodeRabbit agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms, the Service, or communications from us will be resolved through binding arbitration. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, is less formal than a court proceeding, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. Any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement will be resolved by the arbitrator.

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND CODERABBIT ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

**Exceptions**. Although we are agreeing to arbitrate most disputes between us, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

**Opt-Out**. If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 18 within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to CodeRabbit, Inc., Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, 1212 Broadway Plaze, Suite 2100, Walnut Creek, CA 94596 that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (“**Opt-Out Notice**”). Once CodeRabbit receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 18 will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 19. The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.

**Arbitrator**. This arbitration agreement, and any arbitration between us, is subject the Federal Arbitration Act and will be administered by the JAMS under the rules applicable to consumer disputes (collectively, “**JAMS Rules**”) as modified by these Terms. The JAMS Rules and filing forms are available online at www.jamsadr.com, by calling the JAMS at +1-800-352-5267 or by contacting CodeRabbit.

**Commencing Arbitration**. Before initiating arbitration, a party must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“**Notice of Arbitration**”). CodeRabbit’s address for Notice is: CodeRabbit, Inc., 1212 Broadway Plaza, Suite 2100, Walnut Creek, CA 94596. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) identify the name or account number of the party making the claim; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (“**Demand**”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or CodeRabbit may commence an arbitration proceeding. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, CodeRabbit will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US$10,000 or if CodeRabbit has received 25 or more similar demands for arbitration, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the JAMS Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules and the other party may seek reimbursement for any fees paid to JAMS.

**Arbitration Proceedings**. Any arbitration hearing will take place in the county and state of your billing address unless we agree otherwise or, if the claim is for US$10,000 or less (and does not seek injunctive relief), you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a telephonic or video hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the JAMS Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or CodeRabbit must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.

**Arbitration Relief**. Except as provided in the Section titled “No Class Actions”, the arbitrator can award any relief that would be available if the claims had been brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by CodeRabbit before an arbitrator was selected, CodeRabbit will pay to you the higher of: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and (b) US$10,000. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding on all parties, except (1) for judicial review expressly permitted by law or (2) if the arbitrator's award includes an award of injunctive relief against a party, in which case that party shall have the right to seek judicial review of the injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction that shall not be bound by the arbitrator's application or conclusions of law. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

**No Class Actions**. YOU AND CODERABBIT AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and CodeRabbit agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. 

**Modifications to this Arbitration Provision**. If CodeRabbit makes any substantive change to this arbitration provision, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to CodeRabbit’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with CodeRabbit will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.

**Enforceability**. If the Section titled “No Class Actions” or the entirety of this Section 18 is found to be unenforceable, or if CodeRabbit receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section 18 will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 19 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms. 

**19\. GOVERNING LAW**

These Terms of Service and any claim arising out of these Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California.

**20\. SURVIVAL**

After this Terms of Service terminates, the terms of this agreement that expressly or by their nature contemplate performance after termination or expiration will survive and continue in full force and effect. For example, the provisions protecting intellectual property, indemnification, payment of fees, and setting forth limitations of liability each, by their nature, contemplate performance or observance after this Terms of Service terminates. Without limiting any other provisions of the Terms of Service, the termination of these Terms for any reason will not release you from any obligations incurred prior to termination of the Terms or that thereafter may accrue in respect of any act or omission prior to such termination.

**21\. ASSIGNABILITY**

You may not assign the Terms of Service, or any of its rights or obligations hereunder, without CodeRabbit’s prior written consent in the form of a written instrument signed by a duly authorized representative of CodeRabbit. CodeRabbit may freely assign this Terms of Service without your consent. Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this subsection will be null and void. Subject to the foregoing restrictions, the Terms of Service are binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the successors, heirs, and permitted assigns of the parties.

**22\. WAIVER AND SEVERABILITY**

No waiver by CodeRabbit of any term or condition set out in these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of CodeRabbit to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

If any provision of these Terms of Service is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Service will continue in full force and effect.
